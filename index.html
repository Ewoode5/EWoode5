I think that I have a basic understanding of how to use computers and how to make them. Gaming has also taught me alot of how computers work as well and I wish  to learn more about technology as I walk down this path.</font></h4></td>

		About Me
	</font></h1>
	<font face="helvetica" color="black" size="3">
		Growing up I was always going outside with my friends. I would always leave the house and stay out late and my mom would always call me over and over until I came home and there was nothing to do at home but watch TV. I didn't want to stay home, I wanted to go outside with my friends because I thought that going outside with my friends to the park was way more fun to do than staying home all day. Until one day I got my first laptop I discovered all types of games and was overjoyed. I started to stay home just a little bit more, then around 5th grade I received my first console, it was a playstation 3. After I got that my friends started to come over and we would play games here.

   		<td>[Piece 2: In this piece I tried to capture the pure opposite of penguin-ness. The design was especially challenging here because representing objects along a four-dimensional plane proved to require more string theory than I had originally hoped.]</td>
   		<td>[Piece 3: This piece was inspired by the Oregon Trail during a zombie apocalypse. In the multiplicity of materials used, I tried to symbolize the lingering interposition of the Freudian superego along Jungian archetypes throughout Viennese architecture.]</td>
